# 4. ANNUAL QUALIFYING SPEND CATEGORIES AND CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

## 4.1 Purpose and Application

Annual Qualifying Spend (AQS) serves as an independent factor in determining Change Fee modifications, separate from and
in addition to tier status benefits. This Section establishes the methodology for calculating AQS and the resulting
Spend-Based Adjustments applicable under Section 9.

## 4.2 AQS Threshold Categories

For purposes of Spend-Based Adjustments to Change Fees, Members are categorized according to the following AQS
thresholds:

| AQS Category | Annual Qualifying Spend Range | Category Code |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Category 1   | $0 - $999                     | AQS-1         |
| Category 2   | $1,000 - $2,499               | AQS-2         |
| Category 3   | $2,500 - $4,999               | AQS-3         |
| Category 4   | $5,000 - $9,999               | AQS-4         |
| Category 5   | $10,000 - $19,999             | AQS-5         |
| Category 6   | $20,000 - $34,999             | AQS-6         |
| Category 7   | $35,000 - $49,999             | AQS-7         |
| Category 8   | $50,000 - $74,999             | AQS-8         |
| Category 9   | $75,000 - $99,999             | AQS-9         |
| Category 10  | $100,000+                     | AQS-10        |

## 4.3 Calculation Period Definition

### 4.3.1 Standard Calculation Period

The AQS Calculation Period consists of the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the
month in which the Change Request is submitted.

**Example:** For a Change Request submitted on March 15, 2024, the Calculation Period runs from March 1, 2023 through
February 29, 2024.

### 4.3.2 Alternative Calculation Methods

At the Member's election, made by notation in the Change Request or via the Altitude Account Portal, the following
alternative calculation periods may be used:

(a) **Rolling 365-Day Method**: The 365-day period ending on the day prior to the Change Request submission;

(b) **Calendar Year Method**: The most recently completed calendar year, if the Change Request is submitted in the first
quarter and this method yields a higher AQS;

(c) **Blended Method**: A weighted average of the prior calendar year (weighted 60%) and the current partial year
annualized (weighted 40%), available only for Change Requests submitted after July 1.

### 4.3.3 Effective AQS Date

Where the Standard Calculation Period and an Alternative Calculation Method would yield different AQS Categories, the
higher category shall apply (the "AQS Optimization Rule").

unredeemed loyalty.

## 10.3 Complete Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Silver Member with $25,000 AQS and 175,000 Altitude Points changing a Main Cabin Transatlantic flight 10
days before departure

1. Base Change Fee: $400
2. Tier-Adjusted Fee (Silver, 30% off): $400 × 0.70 = $280
3. Spend-Adjusted Fee (AQS-6, 16% off): $280 × 0.84 = $235.20
4. Points Balance: 175,000 = PB-5 (12% discount)
5. Points-Adjusted Fee: $235.20 × 0.88 = $206.98
6. Rounded to nearest dollar: **$207**

**Original fee without any discounts: $400**
**Final fee with all discounts: $207**
**Total savings: $193 (48%)**

## 10.4 Discount Caps

### 10.4.1 Maximum Combined Discount

The combined discount from Tier, Spend, and Points factors shall not exceed:

- 75% for Gold Members
- 65% for Silver Members
- 50% for Bronze Members
- 35% for No Status Members

### 10.4.2 Discount Cap Application

If the calculated combined discount exceeds the applicable cap, the final fee shall be:

Final Fee = Base Change Fee × (1 - Maximum Combined Discount)

### 10.4.3 Cap Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Gold Member (50% tier discount) with AQS-10 (35% discount) and PB-10 (35% discount)

Theoretical combined discount: 50% + 35% + 35% = 120% (impossible)
Actual calculation: 1 - (0.50 × 0.65 × 0.65) = 1 - 0.21125 = 78.875%
Cap for Gold Members: 75%
Applied discount: **75%**

## 10.5 Points Redemption Alternative

# 12. COMBINED FACTOR CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

## 12.1 Calculation Sequence

The final Change Fee is calculated using the following sequence:

1. **Determine Base Change Fee** (Section 7)
    - Identify route category
    - Identify fare family
    - Identify timing window
    - Look up Base Change Fee

2. **Apply Tier Multiplier** (Section 8)
    - Verify Member tier status
    - Apply tier multiplier
    - Result: Tier-Adjusted Fee

3. **Apply AQS Discount** (Section 9)
    - Determine AQS category
    - Apply AQS discount percentage
    - Result: Spend-Adjusted Fee

4. **Apply Points Balance Discount** (Section 10)
    - Determine Points Balance tier
    - Apply points discount percentage
    - Check against Discount Cap
    - Result: Points-Adjusted Fee

5. **Apply Reason-Based Adjustment** (Section 11)
    - Classify change reason
    - Apply waiver or reduction percentage
    - Result: Reason-Adjusted Fee

6. **Add Processing Fee** (Section 7.5)
    - Determine booking channel
    - Apply processing fee (subject to waivers)

7. **Add Late Change Surcharge** (Section 13, if applicable)
    - Determine if within Late Change Window
    - Calculate surcharge (subject to waivers)

8. **Add Peak Period Surcharge** (Section 19, if applicable)
    - Check travel date against Peak Calendar
    - Calculate surcharge (subject to waivers)

9. **Add Third-Party Booking Surcharge** (Section 7.8, if applicable)
    - Verify booking source
    - Apply surcharge

10. **Add Category F Surcharges** (Section 11.7, if applicable)
    - Apply fault-based surcharges
    - Apply multipliers

11. **Apply Floor and Ceiling Limits** (Section 7.7)
    - Verify minimum fee
    - Verify maximum fee cap

12. **Calculate Final Change Fee**

## 12.2 Master Calculation Formula

```
Final Change Fee = MIN(
  MAX(
    ((Base_Fee × Tier_Mult × AQS_Mult × PB_Mult × Reason_Mult) + Processing + Late_Surch + Peak_Surch + 3P_Surch + F_Surch),
    Minimum_Fee
  ),
  Maximum_Fee_Cap
)
```

Where:

- All multiplicative discounts are expressed as (1 - discount_percentage)
- Processing, surcharges may be $0 if waived
- Minimum_Fee from Section 7.7.1
- Maximum_Fee_Cap from Section 7.7.2
